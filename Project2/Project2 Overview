In this project, I create a half adder, full adder, 16 bit adder, 16 bit incrementer, which all allowed to the creation of a basic Arithmatic Logic Unit(ALU) which is capable of addition, subtraction, and other logical operations. Along with this there are two more output pins which allow you to see if the output is either 0, negative, or positive which will come into play for the rest of this computer's architecture.
