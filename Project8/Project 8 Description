In this project, I update the VM machine implementation that I previously made in project 7. I updated the Parser.hpp and made it more robust, and I have also included branching and function call functionalities to the VMWriter class. This implementation
now supports arithmatic, push/pop, branching, and function commands. I have also added a writeInnit() function which will write the assembly code needed to boot up a program at the beginning of each assembly file. The main function has been updated to also support the ability to translate entire directories as well. So now if you have a directory with multiple classes the VM translator will be able to take that directory and translate it all into one asm file.
