In this project I've taken a step back to explore the hack assembly language, which is a more primitive version of the regular assembly languages. In this project I created two assembly programs, one which makes the screen black once a keyboard is pressed, and another which multiplies two positive numbers that are inputted into the first and second registers and the output will be stored in the third register.
